# Sorting Algorithms

## Soft Description
Web app which shows how different sorting algorithms work thanks to a homemade graphical interface.  
This "project" was coded quite quickly so there is no optimization at this point (for thi GUI 
including the chart bar). But for each algorithm, I tried to implement the more optimized solution 
**so the display speed is not correlated with the processing speed of sorting algorithms**.

**There is 7 sorting Algorithms available :**
- Bubble Sort
- Comb Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- OddEven Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Technical Description
- Language: Node.js  
- Framework : Express
- GI (chart bars) : Homemade (canvas of HTML5)

#### What will be my next project ?

Maybe a web app which shows how different path finding algorithms work (A*, Dijkstra), 
it could be great to implement more features like "Uber Pool algorithm", etc ;)
